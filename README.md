This is a school project for my Electrical Engineering Bachelors

This project was to design and make a ball sorter with both an automatic mode and manual mode.
It is fully 3D printed and controlled by a Raspberry Pi 4.

You can see a short video of it working in it's automatic mode here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWurQ5nhMSE
